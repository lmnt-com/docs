Our voices are the backbone of our product and we're proud to offer a variety of voice creation options to suit your needs.


## Types of voices
LMNT offers two types of voice creation: **instant** and **professional**.

### Instant voices
Instant voices are available immediately in all of your applications. While they may not always be perfect,
they are often still of a very high quality. Instant voices are a great way to quickly test out a voice.

### Professional voices
Professional voices are fine-tuned to sound as natural, accurate, and lifelike as possible. 
They require some time to fully train. After completion, you will receive an email notification
and can start using this voice in all of your applications.

Users are limited to a number of professional voice creations based on their [plan](https://lmnt.com/pricing/).

## How to create a voice
You can create a voice in our web app or via our API.

### Web app
To create a voice in our web app, simply navigate to the [cloning page](https://app.lmnt.com/clone-a-voice).
Upload a speech sample, give the voice a name, and click "submit". 

Note that our web app only allows professional voice creations at the moment. If you would like to create an instant voice, use the API.

Some tips:
- Source material should:
    - Contain only one person's voice, in English
    - Not contain background noise/music
- Consider [Adobe's speech enhancer](https://podcast.adobe.com/enhance) if your speech is not professionally recorded
- If cutting larger source material down:
    - Leave gaps between sentences (good)
    - Or upload sections as separate files (best)

### API
To create a voice via our REST API, you can use the [create voice endpoint](/api-reference/voice/create-voice).

You can use a curl command like this to create a voice in your terminal:
```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.lmnt.com/v1/ai/voice \
  --header 'Content-Type: multipart/form-data' \
  --header 'X-API-Key: 5125c321ee36420ea9bef2341974e0f2b' \
  --form files=file:///Users/user/Downloads/filename.wav \
  --form 'metadata={"name": "My Voice", "type": "instant", "enhance": true }'
  ```
<Warning> Don't forget to get your own [API Key!](/api-reference/authentication) </Warning>

If you choose to use the API, you can create both instant and professional voices.
