There are several ways that you can generate speech from text as quickly as possible. 
This page describes some of the techniques that you can use to optimize for low latency.

## Use streaming synthesis
Streaming synthesis is generally the fastest way to generate speech from text. 
It will return audio as soon as it is available, rather than waiting for the entire audio to be generated.
All of our [client libraries](/sdk) support streaming synthesis.

## Use `wav` format instead of `mp3`
The `wav` format is faster to generate than `mp3`. The default for synthesis in our SDKs and REST API is
`mp3`, so you will need to explicitly pass in `format=wav` to use `wav` format. 

<Info> Our [Speech Playground](https://app.lmnt.com) currently
uses `wav` format. </Info>
