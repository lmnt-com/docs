## The basics
LMNT's AI voice models trained on countless hours of speech data allow you to 
easily and quickly generate speech that sounds like a real person. 
You can use LMNT to generate speech for a variety of purposes, including:
- Voiceovers for videos
- Audiobooks and storytelling
- Podcasts
- Virtual assistants
- Video game characters
- Chatbots
- And more!

## The voices
We have a number of pre-built voices available for you to use. 
Each voice is a unique person with their own style and personality. 
You can see our public voices in the [Speech Playground](https://app.lmnt.com) or with a call to 
our [API](/api-reference/voice/list-voices).

However, our pre-built voices are just the start. You can create your own voices from audio samples
that you provide. This allows you to create voices that are unique to your brand or project.
Learn more about [creating custom voices](/voice/overview).

## Get started
1. Explore the [Speech Playground](https://app.lmnt.com) to see what LMNT can do.
2. See how to use our [REST API](/api-reference) or [SDKs](/sdk) to generate speech in your application.
