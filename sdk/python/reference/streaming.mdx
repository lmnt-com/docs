title: 'StreamingSynthesisConnection'
description: 'Reference for the StreamingSynthesisConnection class in the Python SDK'
---

This class represents a full-duplex streaming connection with the server. The expected use is to call `append_text` as text is produced
and to iterate over the object to read audio. Make sure to call `finish()` when you're done submitting the entire text snippet.

To create an instance of this class, use the [`synthesize_streaming`](speech#synthesize-streaming) method on the `Speech` class.

```python
speech = Speech('LMNT_API_KEY')
conn = await speech.synthesize_streaming('mara-wilson')
```

## append_text

> `async append_text(text)`

Sends additional text to synthesize to the server. The text can be split at any point. For example, the two snippets
below are semantically equivalent:

```python
await conn.append_text('This is a test of ')
await conn.append_text('the emergency broadcast system.')
```

```python
await speech.append_text('This is a test of the eme')
await speech.append_text('rgency broadcast system.')
```
-----------

## Async Iterator

> `async __aiter__()`

> `async __anext__()`

Iterates over audio data from the server. See the notes below for details on the audio format. Here's a short
snippet that shows how to iterate over the data:

```python
conn = await speech.synthesize_streaming('mara-wilson')
async for msg in conn:
  msg.audio  # contains a binary string with the audio data
```

### Parameters
- `text` string: Some or all of the text to synthesize

### Notes
- audio is returned as a 96kbps mono MP3 stream with a sampling rate of 24kHz

-----------

## flush
> `async flush()`

Call this when you want to trigger the server to synthesize all the text it
currently has and return the audio data. Audio will be returned via the
async iterator. This is recommended to be used only sparingly, if at all, 
as it can result in a less natural sounding speech. This could be useful if
you are sure you have sent text that comes at a natural stop and want all the
audio returned without closing the connection.

-----------

## finish

> `async finish()`

Call this function when you've written all the text you're expecting to submit. It will flush any remaining data on the server and return the
last chunks of audio via the async iterator. The connection will also be closed.
