title: 'StreamingSynthesisConnection'
description: 'Reference for the StreamingSynthesisConnection class in the Python SDK'
---

This class represents a full-duplex streaming connection with the server. The expected use is to call `append_text` as text is produced
and to iterate over the object to read audio. Make sure to call `finish()` when you're done submitting the entire text snippet.

To create an instance of this class, use the [`synthesize_streaming`](speech#synthesize-streaming) method on the `Speech` class.

```python
speech = Speech('LMNT_API_KEY')
connection = await speech.synthesize_streaming('mara-wilson')
```

## append_text

> `async append_text(text)`

Sends additional text to synthesize to the server. The text can be split at any point. For example, the two snippets
below are semantically equivalent:

```python
await connection.append_text('This is a test of ')
await connection.append_text('the emergency broadcast system.')
```

```python
await connection.append_text('This is a test of the eme')
await connection.append_text('rgency broadcast system.')
```

### Parameters
- `text` string: Some or all of the text to synthesize

### Note
The text is guaranteed to be synthesized in the order that it is sent.

You can access the synthesized data by using the async iterator on the connection object.

-----------

## Async Iterator

> `async __aiter__()`

> `async __anext__()`

Iterates over data returned from the server. See the notes below for details on the object format. Here's a short
snippet that shows how to iterate over the data:

```python
conn = await speech.synthesize_streaming('mara-wilson')
async for msg in conn:
  msg['audio']  # contains a binary string with the audio data
```

Each returned object contains the following properties:
- `audio`: a binary string containing the audio data as 96kbps mono MP3 stream with a sampling rate of 24kHz.
- `durations`: if `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created, this will be an array of the durations of each word in the text.
- `warnings`: if `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created, this will include any warnings about the synthesis.

<Note>
The durations array resets its start time for each chunk of audio returned and there is a 0.45 second gap between each chunk of audio. 
</Note>

-----------

## flush
> `async flush()`

Call this when you want to trigger the server to synthesize all the text it
currently has and return the audio data. Audio will be returned via the
async iterator. This is recommended to be used only sparingly, if at all, 
as it can result in a less natural sounding speech. This could be useful if
you are sure you have sent text that comes at a natural stop and want all the
audio returned without closing the connection.

-----------

## finish

> `async finish()`

Call this function when you've written all the text you're expecting to submit. It will flush any remaining data on the server and return the
last chunks of audio via the async iterator. The connection will also be closed.
