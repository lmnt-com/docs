## Getting Started

### Pre-requisites
- Python 3.6 or higher

<Warning> The SDK may not install with Python 3.12. This is due to an issue with one of our dependency packages, `aiohttp`. 
Follow the issue [here](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/issues/7646). Use a different Python version if needed. </Warning> 

### Install the SDK
To install the latest version, enter the following command:
```bash
pip install -U lmnt
```

The SDK is now ready to use. The `Speech` class is your primary touch-point with the LMNT API. Import it as follows:
```python
from lmnt.api import Speech
```

### Authentication
You will need an API key to use our SDKs. Go to [https://app.lmnt.com](https://app.lmnt.com) to sign up for an account and get your API key.
