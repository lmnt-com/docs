## `class LMNTSpeech : MonoBehavior`
This is the primary class you'll interact with when using LMNT. You can acquire a reference
to an instance of this class by calling `GetComponent` from your script.

### `IEnumerator Prefetch()`
This coroutine allows you to prefetch the dialogue from the network. It is not necessary to call
this coroutine, but doing so can reduce the perceived latency of the network call.

For example, you could call `Prefetch` inside the `Start` method:

```csharp
public class MyScript : MonoBehaviour {
  private LMNTSpeech speech;

  void Start() {
    speech = GetComponent<LMNTSpeech>();
    StartCoroutine(speech.Prefetch());
  }
}
```

and call `Talk` (described below) at a later time, e.g. on a game event.

### `IEnumerator Talk()`
This coroutine begins playback of the configured dialogue. Note that if `Prefetch` was not called
prior to calling `Talk`, this coroutine will start a network request to get the dialogue.
