- A bug was fixed in the REST API that caused the `durations` object in responses from `StreamingSynthesisConnection` to be inaccurate. The `durations` object now correctly reflects the duration of the audio data returned in the `audio` object.

0.1.0 / Nov 14, 2023
- Breaking changes - Please update your code to use the new behavior or pin to a previous version if preferred:
  - Default audio encoding format in `synthesize` is now `mp3` (previously `wav`). Format can be specified by adding the `format='wav'` or `format='mp3'` option to the `synthesize` call.
  - `fetchVoices` now returns a list of voice dictionaries for simplicity of return values and ease of use. Previously it returned a dictionary with key `voices` which contained a dictionary of voice dictionaries keyed by their voice id.
  - `synthesize` no longer returns just the binary audio data. It instead always returns a dictionary with keys `audio`, `durations` (optional), and `seed` (optional).
- Features:
  - Add ability to filter by `starred` and `owner` in `fetchVoices`.
  - Add ability to return `durations` and `seed` from `synthesize`.
  - Add `fetchVoice` method to fetch a single voice.
  - Add `createVoice` method to create a new voice.
  - Add `updateVoice` method to update an existing voice, including starring voices.
  - Add `deleteVoice` method to delete an existing voice.
  - Add `synthesizeStreaming` method to support full-duplex synthesis streaming.
  - Add `fetchAccount` method to fetch account information.

0.0.2 / Sep 20, 2023
- Features:
  - Add optional `length` parameter specifying target speech duration.
  - Make streaming work with the [Edge runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/edge-functions/edge-runtime).
  - Add TypeScript type definitions.
  - Add `close` method to `StreamingSynthesisConnection` class allowing explicit cleanup if desired.
- Bug fixes:
  - End the streaming async iterator when the synthesis is finished.
  - Fix demo link in README.
