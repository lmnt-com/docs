title: 'StreamingSynthesisConnection'
description: 'Reference for the StreamingSynthesisConnection class in the Node.js SDK'
---

This class represents a full-duplex streaming connection with the server. The
expected use is to call `appendText` as text is produced and to iterate over
the object to read audio. Make sure to call `finish()` when you're done
submitting the entire text snippet.

When you're done with the `StreamingSynthesisConnection` instance, you can explicitly clean up its
resource utilization by calling the `close()` method.

To create an instance of this class, use the [`synthesize_streaming`](speech#synthesize-streaming) method on the `Speech` class.

```javascript
const speech = new Speech('LMNT_API_KEY')
const connection = await speech.synthesizeStreaming('mara-wilson')
```
-----------------
## appendText

> `appendText(text)`

Sends additional text to synthesize to the server. The text can be split at any
point. For example, the two snippets below are semantically equivalent:

```js
await connection.appendText('This is a test of ')
await connection.appendText('the emergency broadcast system.')
```

```js
await connection.appendText('This is a test of the eme')
await connection.appendText('rgency broadcast system.')
```

### Parameters
<ResponseField name='text' type='string' required>
  Some or all of the text to synthesize.
</ResponseField>
{/* - `text`: some or all of the text to synthesize */}

### Note
The text is guaranteed to be synthesized in the order that it is sent.

You can access the synthesized data by using the async iterator on the connection object.

-----------------
## Streaming Data Iterator

The connection object provides an async iterator that yields data from
the server as it arrives. See the notes below for details on the return value. Here's a short snippet that shows how to iterate over
the data:

```js
for await (const message of connection) {
  // `message` is an object as described below
  const audio = message.audio;
  const audioBytes = Buffer.byteLength(audio);
  process.stdout.write(`Received ${audioBytes} bytes.`);
  audioFile.write(audio);
}
```

Each returned object contains the following properties:
<ResponseField name='audio' type='Buffer'>
  A binary string containing the synthesized audio data as 96kbps mono MP3 stream with a sampling rate of 24kHz.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="durations" type="array of duration objects">
  An array of text duration objects. Only returned if `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created.
  <Expandable title="properties">
    Each object describes the duration of a chunk of text (e.g., words, punctuation, and spaces) with the following keys:
    <ResponseField name="text" type="string">
      The text itself.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="start" type="number">
      The time at which the text starts, in seconds
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="duration" type="number">
      The overall duration of the text, in seconds
    </ResponseField>
  </Expandable>
</ResponseField>
<Note>
The durations array resets its start time for each chunk of audio returned and there is a 0.45 second silence appended to the end of each chunk of audio that is 
not captured in the durations array. 
</Note>
<ResponseField name='warnings' type='string'>
  If `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created, this will include any warnings about the synthesis.
</ResponseField>
{/*
- `audio`: a binary string containing the audio data as 96kbps mono MP3 stream with a sampling rate of 24kHz.
- `durations`: if `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created, this will be an array of the durations of each word in the text.
- `warnings`: if `return_extras` was set to `true` in when the connection was created, this will include any warnings about the synthesis.

-----------------
## close

> `close()`

Releases resources associated with this instance.

-----------------
## flush
> `async flush()`

Call this when you want to trigger the server to synthesize all the text it
currently has and return the audio data. Audio will be returned via the
async iterator. This is recommended to be used only sparingly, if at all, 
as it can result in a less natural sounding speech. This could be useful if
you are sure you have sent text that comes at a natural stop and want all the
audio returned without closing the connection.

-----------------

## finish

> `finish()`

Call this function when you've written all the text you're expecting to submit.
It will flush any remaining data on the server and return the last chunks of
audio as described above.
