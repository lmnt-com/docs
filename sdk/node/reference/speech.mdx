<Note>
Make sure that you have installed the SDK properly. [Installation](/sdk/node/introduction#installing)
</Note>

The `Speech` class is your primary touch-point with the LMNT API.

Instantiate a `Speech` object with your <Tooltip tip='Create an API key by visiting your account page in our speech playground and signing up for a (free) plan.'>[LMNT API key](/api-reference/authentication):</Tooltip>

```javascript
from lmnt.api import Speech

const speech = new Speech('LMNT_API_KEY')
```

## fetchVoices

> `async fetchVoices(options={})`

Returns the voices available for use in speech synthesis calls.

```javascript
const voices = await speech.fetchVoices()
```

- `options` object (optional): An object containing these optional fields to update. Valid fields are
  - `starred` boolean (optional): if `true`, only return starred voices; Defaults to `false`
  - `owner` string (optional): Specify which voices to return. Choose from `lmnt`, `me`, or `all`. Defaults to `all`.

### Return value
A list of voice metadata objects. Here's a sample object:

```javascript
[
  {

    "id": "curtis",
    "state": "ready",
    "owner": "LMNT",

--------
## fetchVoice
> `async fetchVoice(voice)`

Returns the voice metadata for a single voice.

```javascript
const voice = await speech.fetchVoice('curtis')
```

### Parameters
- `voice` string: The id of the voice to update. Voice ids can be retrieved from `fetchVoices()`.

### Return value

## createVoice
> `async createVoice(name, enhance, filenames, options={})`

Creates a new voice from a set of audio files. Returns the voice metadata object.

```javascript
const filenames = ['file1.wav', 'file2.wav']
const result = await speech.createVoice('new-voice', false, filenames)
```

### Parameters
- `name` string: the name of the voice
- `enhance` boolean: For unclean audio with background noise, applies processing to attempt to improve quality. Not on by default as it can also degrade quality in some circumstances.
- `filenames` string[]: A list of filenames to use for the voice.
- `options` object (optional): An object containing these optional fields to update. Valid fields are
    - `type` string: The type of voice to create. Must be one of `instant` or `professional`. Defaults to `instant`.

The voice metadata object. Here's a sample object:

```javascript
{
    "id": "123444566422",
    "name": "new-voice",
    "owner": "me",
    "state": "ready",
    "starred": false,
    "description": "Totam necessitatibus saepe repudiandae perferendis. Tempora iure provident. Consequatur debitis assumenda. Earum debitis cum.",
    "type": "instant",
    "gender": "male"
}
```

--------
## updateVoice
> `async updateVoice(voice, options={})`

Updates metadata for a specific voice. A voice that is not owned by you can only have its `starred` field updated. 
Only provided fields will be changed.

```javascript
const options = {'name': 'new-voice-name', 'starred': true}
await speech.updateVoice('123444566422', options)
```

### Parameters
- `voice_id` string: The id of the voice to update. If you don't know the id, you can get it from `list_voices()`.
- `options` object (optional): An object containing these optional fields to update. Valid fields are
    - `name` string: The name of the voice
    - `starred` boolean: Whether the voice is starred by you
    - `gender` string: The gender of the voice, e.g. `male`, `female`, `nonbinary`. For categorization purposes.
    - `description` string: A description of the voice.

### Return value
The updated voice metadata object.

--------

## deleteVoice
> `async deleteVoice(voice)`

Deletes a voice and cancels any pending operations on it. The voice must be owned by you. Cannot be undone.

```javascript
await speech.deleteVoice('123444566422')
```

### Parameters
- `voice_id` string: The id of the voice to delete. If you don't know the id, you can get it from `list_voices()`.

### Return value
A success or error message. Here's a sample object:

```javascript
{
    "success": "true"
}
```

## synthesize

> `async synthesize(text, voice, options={})`

Synthesizes speech for a supplied text string.

```javascript
const synthesis = await speech.synthesize('Hello world!', 'curtis')
const audio = synthesis.audio
```

### Parameters
- `text` string: The text to synthesize
- `voice` string: Which voice to render; id is found using the `list_voices` call
- `options` object (optional): An object containing these optional fields to update. Valid fields are
    - `format` string: `aac`, `mp3`, `wav`; Defaults to `mp3` (24kHz 16-bit mono)
    - `length` number: Produce speech of this length in seconds; maximum 300.0 (5 minutes).
    - `return_durations` boolean: Whether to include word durations detail in the response; Defaults to false
    - `return_seed` boolean: Whether to include the seed used for synthesis in the response; Defaults to false
    - `speed` number: Floating point value between 0.25 (slow) and 2.0 (fast); Defaults to 1.0
    - `seed` number: The seed used to specify a different take; Defaults to a random value.

### Return value
An object with the following keys:
- `audio`: The binary audio file.
- `durations`: The word durations detail. Only returned if `return_durations` is `True`.
- `seed`: The seed used for synthesis. Only returned if `return_seed` is `True`.

Each `durations` entry is a dictionary describing the duration of each 'word' with the following keys:
- `text`: The 'word' itself
- `start`: The time at which the 'word' starts, in seconds
- `duration`: The overall duration of the 'word', in seconds

Here is the schema for the return value:

```javascript
{
  "audio": binary-audio-file,
  "durations": [
    {
      "text": "string",
      "start": 0,
      "duration": 0
    }
  ],
  "seed": "string"
}
```

### Notes
- The `mp3` bitrate is 96kbps.

--------

## synthesizeStreaming
> `synthesizeStreaming(voice, options={})`

Creates a new, full-duplex streaming session. You can use the returned
connection object to concurrently stream text content to the server and receive
speech data from the server.

### Parameters
- `voice`: which voice to render; id is found using the `fetchVoices` call
- `options` object (optional): An object containing these optional fields to update. Valid fields are 
  - `speed` float: Floating point value between 0.25 (slow) and 2.0 (fast); Defaults to 1.0.
