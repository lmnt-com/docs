<Warning>
The `metadata` field must come before the `files`. The playground above may not work as expected. We are working on a fix.
</Warning>

<Note>
The metadata field is a stringified JSON object containing the following fields:
- `name` (required): string; The display name for this voice 
- `enhance` (required): bool; For unclean audio with background noise, applies processing to attempt to improve quality. Not on by default as it can also degrade quality in some circumstances. 
- `type` (optional): string; The type of voice to create. Defaults to instant. 
- `gender` (optional): string; A tag describing the gender of this voice. Has no effect on voice creation. 
- `description` (optional): A text description of this voice.
</Note>
