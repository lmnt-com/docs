title: 'Introduction'
description: 'The LMNT Speech REST API provides facilities for synthesizing emotive,
human-like speech audio from text input. There is support for creating custom
voices from a user-provided audio input data set. Those voices can then be used
for speech synthesis, in addition to those already provided as part of the LMNT
system.'
